# Lixie II for Arduino

This library is a work-in-progress, but almost all of the functionality from the original Lixie 1/Edgelit libraries is here, and will have software examples within the next day or so! For now, you can [refer to the original library documentation](https://github.com/connornishijima/Lixie-arduino) for its usage is almost identical. Just change any ocurrance of "Lixie" in your code with "Lixie_II".
